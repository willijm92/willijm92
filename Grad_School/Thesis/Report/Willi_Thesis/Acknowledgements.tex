The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provided the resources necessary to complete this project. Specifically, I'd like to thank Daniel Madrzykowski, Roy McLane, Kristopher Overholt, Keith Stakes, and Craig Weinschenk for their contributions in preparing and conducting the experiments. I'd also like to thank the team from the Delaware County Emergency Services Training Center, namely Deputy Director Kerby Kerber, for providing the location and logistical support needed to successfully conduct the tests for this study.  

Thank you also to Dr. Kevin McGrattan of NIST for his guidance and assistance with preparing the FDS input files and for providing advice and expertise throughout the FDS-related components of this project. I'd like to thank my advisor from the University of Maryland, Dr. James Milke, for his help and direction during my time at Maryland. Additionally, thank you to Dr. Arnaud Trouv\'e for being a member of my defense committee and providing valuable feedback about this project.
