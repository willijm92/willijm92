\chapter{Conclusion}

Nine full-scale fire tests were conducted in two residential-sized structures. Five of the experiments occurred in a single-story structure with three different rooms, and the other four experiments were performed in a two-story structure with the ground level having an open floor plan and the second level having two rooms and a hallway. The fire source for each experiment was provided by a set of three diffusion flame burners with propane as the fuel. Various doors and vents were opened and closed during each test to change ventilation within the structure. Local measurements of temperature, gas velocity, heat flux, and gas concentrations were collected at various locations throughout the structure during the experiments. 

The dimensions of each structure were carefully measured, and their construction materials were well-defined. The locations of the experimental instrumentation were also measured and the times of different experimental events were recorded. Additionally, the total volume of propane delivered to the burners was measured by a rotary gas meter and was used to calculate the heat release rate of the fire during each test. Using this information as input data, simulations of the experiments were created and executed using NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator --- the most common CFD modeling software used by fire protection engineers to predict fire dynamics and smoke movement for potential fire scenarios. The simulation results were compared to the experimental data from the experiments.

The agreement between the FDS simulation data and experimental data for the gas burner experiments is consistent with the statistical values given by the FDS Validation Guide. For the quantities of hot gas layer temperature, ceiling jet temperature, and heat flux, the model bias value was equal to or better than (closer to the ideal value of 1) the overall model bias values given by the FDS Validation Guide. Similarly, the relative standard deviations of the experimental data and model data were equal to or less than (more accurate) the corresponding values for the same data types listed in the validation guide. The model bias and experimental and model relative standard deviations produced for both the $O_2$ and $CO_2$ gas concentrations were very close to or better than the values documented in the FDS Validation Guide. The most significant discrepancy between the documented values and values from the gas burner models was seen in the gas velocity comparison. The difference could be a result of the fact that the tests were conducted outdoors, that the instrumentation used to measure gas velocity had a relatively large uncertainty range, and/or the limitations of LES models like FDS to model turbulent gas flow at a fine resolution.

Overall, the comparison of the simulation data to the experimental data suggests that the accuracy of the FDS models of the gas burner experiments in residential-scale structures is sufficient and comparable to the accuracy of other FDS models of different fire scenarios described in the FDS Validation Guide.
