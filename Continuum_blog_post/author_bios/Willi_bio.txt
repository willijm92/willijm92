Joseph Willi works as an engineer in the Fire Fighting Technology (FFT) Group of the Engineering Laboratory's Fire Research Division (FRD) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). He is also currently pursuing a Master of Science in Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

Joseph first started working with the FFT Group as a student in NIST’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program. He joined the FRD as a full-time engineer in July of 2015. Joseph has conducted firefighter safety research in areas of fire fighting tactics, firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE), and the thermal environment encountered during live-fire training. Joseph’s current research is focused on the impact of hose streams on airflows inside structures and the integration of sensor and computing technologies with firefighter PPE to improve firefighter research and safety.
